# Feature 012: Week 12-13 Conversational Robotics Chapter

**Priority**: P0 (Final gamification requirement)
**Points**: +25 (Content completion)
**Effort**: 30 minutes

## Problem
Missing Week 12-13 chapter prevents 100% completion (currently 225/250 points).

## Goal
Create comprehensive Week 12-13 chapter covering conversational robotics with VLA models.

## Requirements
- Voice interaction (Whisper for ASR)
- LLM integration (Gemini)
- Action generation and execution
- Hardware-specific variants (GPU/Edge/Cloud)
- Code examples for humanoid robots

## Success Metrics
- Chapter published with PersonalizeButton
- Embeddings updated in Qdrant
- Gamification: 225/250 → 250/250 (100%)
