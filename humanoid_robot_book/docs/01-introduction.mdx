# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

## Focus and Theme: AI Systems in the Physical World

**Embodied Intelligence** represents the next frontier of artificial intelligence—systems that don't just process data but interact with and understand the physical world.

### Course Goal

Bridging the gap between the digital brain and the physical body. Students apply their AI knowledge to control Humanoid Robots in simulated and real-world environments.

---

## Quarter Overview

The future of AI extends beyond digital spaces into the physical world. This capstone quarter introduces **Physical AI**—AI systems that function in reality and comprehend physical laws.

Students learn to design, simulate, and deploy humanoid robots capable of natural human interactions using:
- **ROS 2** (Robot Operating System)
- **Gazebo** (Physics simulation)
- **NVIDIA Isaac** (AI-powered robotics platform)

## Your Learning Path

<ContentVariant hardwareType="gpu_workstation">

### For GPU Workstation Users (RTX 4070 Ti / RTX 4090)

**You have the complete Physical AI development environment!**

✅ **What You Can Do:**
- Run **NVIDIA Isaac Sim** locally for photorealistic simulations
- Execute **Gazebo** with full GPU acceleration
- Train **reinforcement learning models** on your local GPU
- Run all **Vision-Language-Action (VLA)** models locally
- Deploy real-time perception pipelines

**Recommended Setup:**
- **OS:** Ubuntu 22.04 LTS (dual-boot or dedicated machine)
- **ROS 2:** Humble or Iron
- **Isaac Sim:** Install Omniverse Launcher → Isaac Sim 2023.1+
- **Python:** 3.10+ with CUDA toolkit

**Your Advantage:** Complete hands-on experience from simulation to deployment without cloud costs.

</ContentVariant>

<ContentVariant hardwareType="edge_device">

### For Edge Device Users (Jetson Orin Nano / AGX Orin)

**You have the embedded AI brain for real robots!**

✅ **What You Can Do:**
- Run **Isaac ROS** packages (hardware-accelerated perception)
- Deploy **trained models** for real-time inference
- Execute **VSLAM** (Visual SLAM) and navigation
- Run lightweight **Gazebo simulations**
- Interface with **real sensors** (RealSense cameras, LiDAR)

⚠️ **Limitations:**
- Cannot run full Isaac Sim (use cloud or workstation for training)
- Limited to Gazebo for local simulation
- Focus on deployment rather than training

**Recommended Setup:**
- **OS:** Ubuntu 22.04 LTS (JetPack 5.1+)
- **ROS 2:** Humble
- **Isaac ROS:** Install via apt packages
- **Sensors:** Intel RealSense D435i recommended

**Your Advantage:** Learn real-world deployment and edge computing—the most challenging part of robotics!

</ContentVariant>

<ContentVariant hardwareType="cloud_mac">

### For Cloud/Mac Users

**You can learn robotics through cloud-based simulation!**

✅ **What You Can Do:**
- Run **Gazebo in Docker** (works on Mac via Rosetta)
- Use **Omniverse Cloud** for Isaac Sim (requires subscription)
- Learn **ROS 2 concepts** via Docker containers
- Deploy to **cloud-based robot fleets**
- Focus on high-level planning and AI integration

⚠️ **Considerations:**
- Cloud costs for Isaac Sim (~$1.50/hour on AWS)
- Docker performance on Mac may be slower
- No local GPU acceleration

**Recommended Setup:**
- **Docker Desktop** for Mac/Windows
- **AWS/Azure account** for cloud GPU access (optional)
- **Omniverse Cloud** trial account
- **ROS 2 Docker images** (osrf/ros:humble-desktop)

**Your Advantage:** Platform independence—learn anywhere, deploy to cloud robots.
