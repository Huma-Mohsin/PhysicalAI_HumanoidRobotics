# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

## Focus and Theme: AI Systems in the Physical World

**Embodied Intelligence** represents the next frontier of artificial intelligence—systems that don't just process data but interact with and understand the physical world.

### Course Goal

Bridging the gap between the digital brain and the physical body. Students apply their AI knowledge to control Humanoid Robots in simulated and real-world environments.

---

## Quarter Overview

The future of AI extends beyond digital spaces into the physical world. This capstone quarter introduces **Physical AI**—AI systems that function in reality and comprehend physical laws.

Students learn to design, simulate, and deploy humanoid robots capable of natural human interactions using:
- **ROS 2** (Robot Operating System)
- **Gazebo** (Physics simulation)
- **NVIDIA Isaac** (AI-powered robotics platform)

---

## Why Physical AI Matters

Humanoid robots are poised to excel in our human-centered world because they:

1. **Share our physical form** - Designed to navigate human environments
2. **Learn from abundant data** - Trained through interaction in physical spaces
3. **Represent a paradigm shift** - From digital-only AI to embodied intelligence

This course marks a significant transition from AI models confined to digital environments to **embodied intelligence** that operates in physical space.
