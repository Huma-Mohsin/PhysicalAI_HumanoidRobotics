# Translation Functionality Guide

## Overview

This documentation includes a built-in Urdu translation feature that allows users to toggle between English and Urdu content.

## How It Works

1. **Translation Toggle**: Click the "اردو" button to translate content to Urdu
2. **RTL Support**: Text direction automatically switches to right-to-left for Urdu
3. **Content Preservation**: Code blocks and formatting are preserved during translation

## Current Implementation

The translation system includes:
- Comprehensive dictionary with 1800+ technical terms
- Smart translation that preserves code blocks and HTML
- Caching for performance optimization
- RTL styling for Urdu content

## Limitations

Currently, the main documentation content is rendered by Docusaurus and requires manual wrapping with translation components to be translated. The toggle functionality is working and provides:

- Language state management
- RTL styling application
- Translation infrastructure
- Custom translation components for content

## Using Translation Components

To make content translatable, wrap it with the provided components:

```jsx
import TranslatableText from '@site/src/components/Translation/TranslatableText';

<TranslatableText>This content will be translated</TranslatableText>
```

## Future Enhancements

For automatic translation of all documentation content, a build-time or DOM-interception approach would be needed, which is outside the scope of this implementation.

## Technical Details

The translation system uses:
- React Context for state management
- Comprehensive English-to-Urdu dictionary
- Format-preserving translation logic
- Caching mechanism for performance
