# Hardware Requirements

This course is technically demanding. It sits at the intersection of three heavy computational loads:
- **Physics Simulation** (Isaac Sim/Gazebo)
- **Visual Perception** (SLAM/Computer Vision)
- **Generative AI** (LLMs/VLA)

Because the capstone involves a "Simulated Humanoid," the primary investment must be in **High-Performance Workstations**. However, to fulfill the "Physical AI" promise, you also need **Edge Computing Kits** (brains without bodies) or specific robot hardware.

## 1. The "Digital Twin" Workstation (Required per Student)

This is the **most critical component**. NVIDIA Isaac Sim is an Omniverse application that requires "RTX" (Ray Tracing) capabilities. Standard laptops (MacBooks or non-RTX Windows machines) will **not work**.

| Component | Specification | Rationale |
|-----------|--------------|-----------|
| **GPU** (The Bottleneck) | **NVIDIA RTX 4070 Ti (12GB VRAM)** or higher | You need high VRAM to load the USD (Universal Scene Description) assets for the robot and environment, plus run the VLA (Vision-Language-Action) models simultaneously. |
| **GPU** (Ideal) | **RTX 3090 or 4090 (24GB VRAM)** | Allows for smoother "Sim-to-Real" training with larger scene complexity. |
| **CPU** | Intel Core i7 (13th Gen+) or AMD Ryzen 9 | Physics calculations (Rigid Body Dynamics) in Gazebo/Isaac are CPU-intensive. |
| **RAM** | **64 GB DDR5** (32 GB absolute minimum) | 32 GB will crash during complex scene rendering. 64 GB provides headroom. |
| **OS** | **Ubuntu 22.04 LTS** | While Isaac Sim runs on Windows, ROS 2 (Humble/Iron) is native to Linux. Dual-booting or dedicated Linux machines are mandatory for a friction-free experience. |

:::warning GPU Requirement
Standard laptops (MacBooks or non-RTX Windows machines) **cannot run** NVIDIA Isaac Sim. You must have an NVIDIA RTX GPU.

## 2. The "Physical AI" Edge Kit

Since a full humanoid robot is expensive, students learn "Physical AI" by setting up the nervous system on a desk before deploying it to a robot. This kit covers Module 3 (Isaac ROS) and Module 4 (VLA).

| Component | Model | Price (Approx.) | Role |
|-----------|-------|-----------------|------|
| **The Brain** | NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano (8GB) or Orin NX (16GB) | $249 - $599 | Industry standard for embodied AI. Students will deploy their ROS 2 nodes here to understand resource constraints vs. their powerful workstations. |
| **The Eyes** | Intel RealSense D435i or D455 | $349 | Provides RGB (Color) and Depth (Distance) data. Essential for the VSLAM and Perception modules. |
| **The Inner Ear** | Generic USB IMU (BNO055) | $30 - $50 | Often built into the RealSense D435i or Jetson boards, but a separate module helps teach IMU calibration. |
| **Voice Interface** | ReSpeaker USB Mic Array v2.0 | $69 | Far-field microphone for voice commands and the "Voice-to-Action" Whisper integration (Module 4). |
| **Storage** | 128GB microSD Card (High-endurance) | $30 | Required for Jetson OS. |
| **Total** | | **~$700 per kit** | |

:::tip Economy Kit
The **Jetson Orin Nano Super Dev Kit** (8GB) is now $249 (price dropped from ~$499), making it more accessible for students.

## 3. The Robot Lab

For the "Physical" part of the course, you have three tiers of options depending on budget.

### Option A: The "Proxy" Approach (Recommended for Budget)

Use a quadruped (dog) or a robotic arm as a proxy. The software principles (ROS 2, VSLAM, Isaac Sim) transfer 90% effectively to humanoids.

| Robot | Price | Pros | Cons |
|-------|-------|------|------|
| **Unitree Go2 Edu** | $1,800 - $3,000 | Highly durable, excellent ROS 2 support, affordable enough to have multiple units | Not a biped (humanoid) |

### Option B: The "Miniature Humanoid" Approach

Small, table-top humanoids.

| Robot | Price | Notes |
|-------|-------|-------|
| **Unitree G1** | ~$16,000 | Research-grade humanoid with open SDK |
| **Robotis OP3** | ~$12,000 | Older but stable platform |
| **Hiwonder TonyPi Pro** | ~$600 | Budget alternative (runs on Raspberry Pi, limited Isaac ROS support) |

:::warning Budget Humanoids
Cheap kits (Hiwonder) usually run on Raspberry Pi, which **cannot run NVIDIA Isaac ROS efficiently**. Use these only for kinematics (walking) and use the Jetson kits for AI.
:::

### Option C: The "Premium" Lab (Sim-to-Real specific)

If the goal is to actually deploy the Capstone to a real humanoid:

| Robot | Price | Why? |
|-------|-------|------|
| **Unitree G1 Humanoid** | ~$16,000 | One of the few commercially available humanoids that can walk dynamically and has an SDK open enough for students to inject their own ROS 2 controllers. |

## 4. Summary of Architecture

To teach this successfully, your lab infrastructure should look like this:

| Component | Hardware | Function |
|-----------|----------|----------|
| **Sim Rig** | PC with RTX 4080 + Ubuntu 22.04 | Runs Isaac Sim, Gazebo, Unity, and trains LLM/VLA models |
| **Edge Brain** | Jetson Orin Nano | Runs the "Inference" stack. Students deploy their code here |
| **Sensors** | RealSense Camera + Lidar | Connected to the Jetson to feed real-world data to the AI |
| **Actuator** | Unitree Go2 or G1 (Shared) | Receives motor commands from the Jetson |

:::danger Critical Note
If you do not have access to RTX-enabled workstations, we must restructure the course to rely entirely on **cloud-based instances** (like AWS RoboMaker or NVIDIA's cloud delivery for Omniverse), though this introduces significant latency and cost complexity.
:::

---

## Option 2: High OpEx - The "Ether" Lab (Cloud-Native)

**Best for**: Rapid deployment, or students with weak laptops.

### 1. Cloud Workstations (AWS/Azure)

Instead of buying PCs, you rent instances.

| Component | Specification | Cost |
|-----------|---------------|------|
| **Instance Type** | AWS g5.2xlarge (A10G GPU, 24GB VRAM) or g6e.xlarge | ~$1.50/hour |
| **Software** | NVIDIA Isaac Sim on Omniverse Cloud | Requires specific AMI |
| **Usage** | 10 hours/week × 12 weeks = 120 hours | - |
| **Storage** | EBS volumes for saving environments | ~$25/quarter |
| **Total Cloud Bill** | | **~$205 per quarter** |

### 2. Local "Bridge" Hardware

You cannot eliminate hardware entirely for "Physical AI." You still need the edge devices to deploy the code physically.

- **Edge AI Kits**: Jetson Kit ($700 one-time purchase)
- **Robot**: One physical robot for final demo ($3,000 - Unitree Go2)

### 3. The Latency Trap (Hidden Cost)

:::warning Cloud Limitations
Simulating in the cloud works well, but **controlling a real robot from a cloud instance is dangerous** due to latency.

**Solution**: Students train in the Cloud, download the model (weights), and flash it to the local Jetson kit.
:::

## The Economy Jetson Student Kit

**Best for**: Learning ROS 2, Basic Computer Vision, and Sim-to-Real control.

| Component | Model | Price (Approx.) | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-----------------|-------|
| **The Brain** | NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano Super Dev Kit (8GB) | $249 | New official MSRP (Price dropped from ~$499). Capable of 40 TOPS. |
| **The Eyes** | Intel RealSense D435i | $349 | Includes IMU (essential for SLAM). Do not buy the D435 (non-i). |
| **The Ears** | ReSpeaker USB Mic Array v2.0 | $69 | Far-field microphone for voice commands (Module 4). |
| **Wi-Fi** | (Included in Dev Kit) | $0 | The new "Super" kit includes the Wi-Fi module pre-installed. |
| **Power/Misc** | SD Card (128GB) + Jumper Wires | $30 | High-endurance microSD card required for the OS. |
| **TOTAL** | | **~$700 per kit** | |
